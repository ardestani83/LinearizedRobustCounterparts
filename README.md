This repository includes data sets and codes used in the following paper:

Ardestani-Jaafari, Amir, and Erick Delage. Linearized robust counterparts of two-stage robust optimization problems with applications in operations management. GERAD, École des Hautes études commerciales, 2016.

It contains three folders: "Section5" includes the Matlab code used for the numerical study of Section 5 focusing on the robust location-transportation problem. "Section6" includes the Matlab code used for the numerical study of Section 6 focusing on a robust newsvendor problem. Finally, "Appendices" includes the  Matlab code used for the numerical study of all examples presented in the Appendix section of the paper.

Implementing the repository requires the following software:

Matlab: it is the main platform of this repository

YALMIP: it is used as a mathematical programming language (more detail: https://yalmip.github.io/)

CPLEX: it is required for solving linear programming and mixed-integer linear programming

MOSEK: it is required for solving for semi-definite programming
