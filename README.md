This repository includes data sets and codes used in the following paper:

Ardestani-Jaafari, Amir, and Erick Delage. Linearized robust counterparts of two-stage robust optimization problems with applications in operations management. GERAD, École des Hautes études commerciales, 2016.

It contains three folders: "Section5" includes the numerical study of Section 5 in the above paper for the robust location-transportation problem. "Section6" includes the numerical study of Section 6 in the above paper for a robust newsvendor problem. Finally, "Appendices" includes the numerical study of the Appendix section in the above paper.

Implementing the repository requires the following software:

Matlab: it is the main platform of this repository

YALMIP: it is used as a mathematical programming language (more detail: https://yalmip.github.io/)

CPLEX: it is required for solving linear programming and mixed-integer linear programming

MOSEK: it is required for solving for semi-definite programming
